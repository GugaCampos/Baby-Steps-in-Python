These simple but usable apps were some of my very first projects that I made while learning Python.
The first one, a calculator without much ado, then an updated version of said calculator, one with more jazz and presentation
With the knowledge acquired from the calculators, I created a converter from Metric to Imperial or vice-versa, as I found myself in need of it in life.
